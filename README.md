I Love to understand the depths of programming! Why? Cause computers are like a known mystery! There are in-finite things to learn about how computers were and are built, and Unix-like scripting (in other words, Bash Scripting - Bourne another shell) is a very interesting Rabbit Hole to dive into. 

It's almost like you are in a movie - The Matrix or Jason Bourne - My all-time favorites!

You can take complete control of your computer if you know how to program it! This era is a golden opportunity to do exactly that. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this and explore those scripts in this repo and improvise more...
