I Love to understand the depths of programming! Why? Cause, computers are like known mystery! There's in-finte things to learn about how computers were and are built, and Unix-like scripting (in other words Bash Scripting - Bourne another shell)
is a very interesing Rabbit Hole to dive into. 

You can take complete control of your computer if you know how to program it! This era is golden opportunity to exactly that. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this and explore those scripts in this repo
and improvise more...
